        # Conv layers
        self.conv1 = nn.Conv2d(1, 16, 3, padding=1)    # 28x28 -> 28x28
        self.bn1 = nn.BatchNorm2d(16)

        self.conv2 = nn.Conv2d(16, 16, 3, padding=1)   # 28x28 -> 28x28 (will pool after)
        self.bn2 = nn.BatchNorm2d(16)

        self.conv3 = nn.Conv2d(16, 32, 3, padding=1)   # 7x7 -> 7x7
        self.bn3 = nn.BatchNorm2d(32)

        self.conv4 = nn.Conv2d(32, 32, 3, padding=1)   # 3x3 -> 3x3
        self.bn4 = nn.BatchNorm2d(32)

        self.conv5 = nn.Conv2d(32, 16, 1)             # 3x3 -> 3x3 bottleneck
        self.bn5 = nn.BatchNorm2d(16)

        self.conv6 = nn.Conv2d(16, 16, 3)             # 3x3 -> 3x3
        self.bn6 = nn.BatchNorm2d(16)

        # Pooling
        self.pool = nn.MaxPool2d(2, 2)

        # Global Average Pooling
        self.gap = nn.AdaptiveAvgPool2d(1)  # final output: [batch, 16, 1, 1]

## Code Changes

The following modifications were made to the original code:

1. **Device Configuration**: Added explicit device selection for CUDA/CPU
   ```python
   device = torch.device("cuda" if torch.cuda.is_available() else "cpu") # changed: added this line
   ```

2. **Optimizer Changes**: Switched from SGD to Adam optimizer with weight decay
   ```python
   # Changed from SGD to Adam with L2 regularization
   optimizer = optim.Adam(model.parameters(), lr=0.001, weight_decay=1e-4)
   ```

3. **Learning Rate Scheduler**: Modified StepLR scheduler
   ```python
   scheduler = optim.lr_scheduler.StepLR(optimizer, step_size=15, gamma=0.1) # changed: removed verbose=True
   ```

4. **Training Epochs**: Increased from 19 to 20 epochs
   ```python
   # for epoch in range(1, 19): # changed # epochs
   num_epochs = 20
   ```

5. **Loss Function**: Updated to use CrossEntropyLoss
   ```python
   criterion = nn.CrossEntropyLoss() # changed: can add reduction='sum'
   ```

6. **Test Function**: Fixed test function call
   ```python
   test(model, device, test_loader, criterion) # changed: train to test_loader
   ```
